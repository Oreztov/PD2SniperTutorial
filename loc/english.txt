"heist_tut1_name": "The Bolivian Hit"
"heist_tut1_brief": "The local Bolivian drug boss is getting too big for his own good - and paranoid, of course. He's set up in a militarized private mansion at the rural fields out of town, together with an assistant and a flock of guards. As of late the boss is trying to buy his way into politics using drug money, with the assistant acting as a front for the whole operation - and my client's having none of that. Due to the nature of this job, it's best to do it from afar, meaning you're going sniping. Make sure to check the assets for useful equipment and info. Oh, and it's about time you learn a thing or two, right?"

"obj_3_collat": "Clear watchtower with a collateral"

"obj_7_boss": "Eliminate the boss and assistant"
"obj_7_boss_desc": "The contractor has found your targets on the camera feed. Problem is, you can't see them even from your vantage point. Kill the targets with a wall piercing shot!"
"obj_8_divert": "Shoot the explosive barrels"
"obj_8_divert_desc": "They're catching on to what's happening, make a quick diversion by exploding the barrels together with the gas tank next to the hangar."

"tut_obj_1": "Alright, you're in, get to the vantage point."
"tut_obj_2": "Now this is a nice view! Well, the guards on the airstip are very close to your position and could cause problems. Take all five of them out."
"tut_obj_3": "Next up - the watchtower. The two guards in there have got a clear line of sight and you must kill them both in one shot. Otherwise, they'll raise the alarm."
"tut_obj_3_fail": "No, no... You had to kill them both in one single shot!"
"tut_obj_3_skip": "Looks like you've already cleared the watchtower! Moving on..."
"tut_obj_4": "Now that the coast is clear, we've gotta find the targets with a hack. The network details are found in that room, shoot open its door."
"tut_obj_4_skip": "Oh, you've already shot the door open? Well then, let's continue..."
"tut_obj_5": "Every good sniper needs to communicate with his mates. Send me the network details on that device next to you."
"tut_obj_6": "Password is 1234, very secure... Anyway, I'll start hacking into the camera feed, it should take about 30 seconds."
"tut_obj_6_fail": "Fuck! The security team spotted the hack, we're done for!"
"tut_obj_6_panik": "Shit! They've noticed suspicious activity on the network and are sending guards. DO NOT LET THEM ENTER THE ROOM!"
"tut_obj_7": "Okay, okay, hack complete... I'm looking through the camera feed for our two targets. Looks like the boss is in the bathroom and the assistant in her office, and you don't have line of sight on either. I'm gonna mark them out, and you've gotta kill them with a wall piercing shot."
"tut_obj_8": "Hit complete! But they're catching on to what's happening. Make a quick diversion by shooting the explosive barrels, and keep your head down."
"tut_obj_8_fail": "What are you doing? You've alerted everybody!"
"tut_obj_9": "Good job! Now set up a zipline, and get out of there."
